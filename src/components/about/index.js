          My name is Masami and I love to cook. I created this blog to share
          recipes, cooking tips, and stories about food. Cook with me!

          A little bit about me: I'm a marketer by day and self-taught home cook
          by night and weekend. I can never pass up a farmer's market and love
          exploring new restaurants (when it is safe!) Pasta is my favorite food
          and I'm currently obsessing over eggplant. I currently reside in DC
          with my partner Harry, who helped design this blog. I hope you enjoy!
