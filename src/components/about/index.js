    Welcome to masamicooks.com!
    </h3>
    <p>My name is Masami and I love to cook. I created this blog to share recipes, cooking tips, and stories about food. Cook with me!</p>
    <p>A little bit about me: I'm a marketer by day and self-taught home cook by night and weekend. I can never pass up a farmer's market and love exploring new restaurants (when it is safe!) Pasta is my favorite food and I'm currently obsessing over eggplant. I currently reside in DC with my partner Harry, who helped design this blog. I hope you enjoy!
